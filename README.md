Thank you for interviewing with us. You will find two folders that each contain an animated GIF. Your goal is to recreate the demonstrated code as closely as possible. One is a CSS focused problem(/css/CSSexercise.gif) and other is a JavaScript focused problem(/js/JSexercise.gif). The exercises are open book with no strict time limit, although we do expect them to be completed within a day or so. If an external problem arises that prevents you from completing the questions in the allotted time, please make us aware so that necessary arrangements can be made. 

Save your code to a GitHub (or similar) repository and provide the links back to us.
